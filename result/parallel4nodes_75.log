Executable:   /shared/home/sdsc/gromacs2020/bin/gmx_mpi
Data prefix:  /shared/home/sdsc/gromacs2020
Working dir:  /shared/home/sdsc/result
Command line:
  gmx_mpi mdrun -nb gpu -ntomp 1 -pin auto -s benchPEP.tpr

Reading file benchPEP.tpr, VERSION 4.6.2-dev-20130529-36d170c (single precision)
Note: file tpx version 83, software tpx version 119
Changing nstlist from 40 to 100, rlist from 1.283 to 1.347

On host ip-0A000408 4 GPUs selected for this run.
Mapping of GPU IDs to the 24 GPU tasks in the 24 ranks on this node:
  PP:0,PP:0,PP:0,PP:0,PP:0,PP:0,PP:1,PP:1,PP:1,PP:1,PP:1,PP:1,PP:2,PP:2,PP:2,PP:2,PP:2,PP:2,PP:3,PP:3,PP:3,PP:3,PP:3,PP:3
PP tasks will do (non-perturbed) short-ranged and most bonded interactions on the GPU
PP task will update and constrain coordinates on the CPU
Using 96 MPI processes

Non-default thread affinity set, disabling internal thread affinity

Using 1 OpenMP thread per MPI process


NOTE: Your choice of number of MPI ranks and amount of resources results in using 1 OpenMP threads per rank, which is most likely inefficient. The optimum is usually between 2 and 6 threads per rank.

NOTE: DLB will not turn on during the first phase of PME tuning
