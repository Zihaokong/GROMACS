  gmx_mpi mdrun -s production.tpr -g md_replica_gromos_1.log -o md_replica_gromos_1.trr -e md_replica_gromos_1.edr

Reading file production.tpr, VERSION 2020.4 (single precision)
Changing nstlist from 20 to 80, rlist from 1.226 to 1.333

Using 150 MPI processes

Non-default thread affinity set, disabling internal thread affinity

Using 4 OpenMP threads per MPI process


WARNING: This run will generate roughly 35412 Mb of data

starting mdrun 'VIRAL PROTEIN in water'
2000000 steps,   4000.0 ps.

Writing final coordinates.


Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was off during the run due to low measured imbalance.
 Average load imbalance: 8.5%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 78%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 6.6%.
 Average PME mesh/force load: 1.058
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to PP/PME imbalance: 4.2 %

NOTE: 6.6 % of the available CPU time was lost due to load imbalance
      in the domain decomposition.
      You might want to use dynamic load balancing (option -dlb.)
      You can also consider manually changing the decomposition (option -dd);
      e.g. by using fewer domains along the box dimension in which there is
      considerable inhomogeneity in the simulated system.

Back Off! I just backed up confout.gro to ./#confout.gro.1#


Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was off during the run due to low measured imbalance.
 Average load imbalance: 5.5%.

 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 4.2%.
 Average PME mesh/force load: 1.078
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to PP/PME imbalance: 5.4 %

NOTE: 5.4 % performance was lost because the PME ranks
      had more work to do than the PP ranks.
      You might want to increase the number of PME ranks
      or increase the cut-off and the grid spacing.
