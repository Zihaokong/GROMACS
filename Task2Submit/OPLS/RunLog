Changing nstlist from 20 to 80, rlist from 1.226 to 1.332

Using 180 MPI processes

Non-default thread affinity set, disabling internal thread affinity

WARNING: This run will generate roughly 35509 Mb of data

2000000 steps,   4000.0 ps.

Writing final coordinates.


Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was off during the run due to low measured imbalance.
 Average load imbalance: 10.4%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 73%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 7.6%.
 Average PME mesh/force load: 1.060
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to PP/PME imbalance: 4.2 %

NOTE: 7.6 % of the available CPU time was lost due to load imbalance
      in the domain decomposition.
      You might want to use dynamic load balancing (option -dlb.)
      You can also consider manually changing the decomposition (option -dd);
      e.g. by using fewer domains along the box dimension in which there is
      considerable inhomogeneity in the simulated system.

NOTE: 6 % of the run time was spent communicating energies,
      you might want to increase some nst* mdp options
